# Testing

A simple poll application created for testing your (programming) skills.
Written in React + Redux, kindly bundled by Webpack.
Created without using CSS frameworks with BEM methodology.

Stack of frontend technologies used in this project: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript ES6 + Babel, React, Redux, Webpack, Pug, SASS, PostCSS

## Possibilities:
 1. Getting questions from JSON-file or AJAX call
 2. Saving user answers to the state and to localStorage if it's available
 3. Countdown to the deadline with pausing and unpausing
 4. Disabling next question button if there is no selected answer
 5. Syntax highlighting (by highlight.js)
 6. Alerts! Disappear in 6 seconds
 7. Mobiles, tablets and desktops adaptive
 8. Pure CSS customizable radio-buttons
 9. Pixel perfect!

In Chrome you can go to the next question by selecting an answer and pressing Enter. Currently working on application hotkeys like switching between answers, pausing/unpausing etc.

## Running
First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies.

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:8080> in your browser.
